æ	e	æ	Alphabetic	An 'e' grapheme with a tail on the bottom left or left side. It is often (but not always) used to represent an alphabeme 'e' in lieu of which in classical and modern Latin orthography we would have the diphthong 'ae'. When it is not represented by the 'æ' grapheme, it is represeented by a simple 'e' grapheme.

¦		;̇	Punctuation	This punctuation sign is composed of three signs. The bottom sign looks like a comma, the middle one like a dot (allograph vertical1.png) or like a horizontal dash(allograph vertical2.png) and the top one like a dot. It is used starting from folio 2v, column a, line 35 and seems to be due to the second hand, that writes in black ink.	vertical1.png vertical2.png	1	2v.a.35
