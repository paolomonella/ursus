æ	ae	ę	Alphabetic		"This is an ""e caudatum"": an ""e"" grapheme with a tail on the bottom left or left side. It is often (but not always) used to represent the diphthong ""ae"", which is often represented by a simple ""e"" grapheme elsewhere in the manuscript. It has one allograph (see image ecaudatum1.png) with the tail underneath the body of the grapheme, turning right, and a second allograph (ecaudatum2.png) with the tail on the left of the body (mostly in ligatures)."	ecaudatum1.png ecaudatum2.png	1	1r.a.9

.		.	Punctuation	Full stop, written on the base line.	punct_full_stop.png	1		
·		·	Punctuation	Middle dot, written at middle heigth.	punct_middle_dot.png	1	1r.a.7	
|		⸴ 	Punctuation	It looks like a comma, written from the middle to the base line. I think that the glyph in image punct_triangle.png (found in 1r.a.18) is an allograph.	punct_comma.png punct_triangle.png punct_comma_tail.png	1	1r.a.8	
⸟		⸟	Punctuation	Punctuation sign for interrogative sentences. The ink is faded, but it seems to look like a tilde with one dot below only (not with two dots, as it usually is in the Beneventan script).	punct_question.png	1	1r.a.23

ï	 	,̈	Punctuation	This punctuation sign is composed by a comma with two dots above it, in a horizontal row (so a comma with a diaeresis above).	punct_comma_diaeresis.png	1	2r.a.5	
¦		;̇	Punctuation	"This punctuation sign is composed by a comma with two dots above it, in a vertical row. It is used starting from folio 2v, column a, line 35 and seems to be due to the second hand, that writes in black ink. The graphemes encoded with ""ł"", ""ï"" and ""¦"" might alternatively be considered three allographs of the same grapheme. "	punct_comma_2dots.png	1	2v.a.35

ų	u	̆	Abbreviation mark	"A small ""u"" written over a ""q"". The ""q-with-ų-above"" abbreviation means ""qu"".
